#Groupme Gif-Bot

## Introduction

Gifbot is a welcome addition to any Groupme chat.

He just sits there quietly without making a peep until you need him.

Simply begin your message with "/g" and then type in whatever you're thinking, gifbot will do the rest.

## Requirements:

  * GroupMe account
  * Heroku account
  * Giphy Private key account is optional depending on your volume

To create your GroupMe bot:
https://dev.groupme.com/session/new

Setup an account on Heroku (download their client also): 
[Heroku](http://heroku.com).

## Get your credentials

All you really need is the BOT_ID from inside the dev.groupme site.

Their API is very friendly to work with.

Feel free to email me if you run into trouble or have suggestions.
